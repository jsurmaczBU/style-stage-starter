Style Stage Starter Files for Homework

Visit (https://stylestage.dev/) for instructions, ideas, and inspiration. You MAY NOT modify the HTML. You will write CSS ONLY for this assignment.

A few designs from the site that I think are nice (do not copy these):
- [iStage](https://stylestage.dev/styles/istage/)
